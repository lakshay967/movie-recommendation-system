# Movie Recommendation System

A **content-based Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python, Flask, and Machine Learning**.

The system suggests films to a specified movie by analyzing **genres and plot resemblance** through **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**.



# Key Features

- Content-based movie recommendations (no user login required)

- Uses **TF-IDF (unigrams + bigrams)** for text vectorization

- **Cosine Similarity** for measuring similarity between movies

- Handles large real-world dataset (TMDB 5000 movies)

- Fuzzy search suggestions for incorrect movie names

- Modern and responsive UI

- Animated recommendation cards

- Movie cards that can be clicked lead, to IMDb search results pages


# How the Recommendation System Works

1. Movie **genres** and **overview text** are combined into a single content feature

2. Numerical vectors are created from text data through the use of **TF-IDF**

3. **Cosine Similarity** is computed among all movie vectors.

4. When a user inputs a movie title:

- The system identifies the closely corresponding title

- Suggests the **leading N movies with the similarity**

This method guarantees that suggestions rely on **movie content** proving efficient even in the absence of user interaction information.
